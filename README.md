We struggled to find observable trends in our plots but there were a few common things that we noticed. In all cases where we observed changes over time, we saw that the perturbed ensemble appeared similar to the reference ensemble by the end of the time series.

The number of null hypothesis rejections from the data for the Rejections by Time, Average Latitude, and Model Levels and model levels for t chart shows that the null hypothesis rejections are low (0-15%) for around 20 days, and then quickly increase to high (65-100%) around 20-70 days after start time. After around 70 days, the number of null hypothesis rejections hovers around 45-60% for the rest of the run. The trend between model level and null hypothesis rejection percentage is constant.

For the graph for the rejections over time on the time vs latitude graph for the perturbed ensemble the relationships are the exact same for the number of null hypotheses over time. This time, the percentage of null hypothesis is roughly constant with latitude.

The hypothesis rejection percentage for the theoretical pressure level vs time graph started around 0-20 percent for the first 20 days of 2011, jusmped to 100 percent around the 20-70 day mark. After around day 7- the null hypthesis rejection percentage gernally increased with pressure level for the rest of the graph. This is coinciding with the hypthesis rejection percentage staying nearly constant over time after day 70.

Additionally, when looking at variables that dealt with heights, the lower heights (higher pressures) always had more null hypothesis rejections.

They became visually indistinguishable at different rates. In most cases, they were all visually indistinguishable by some time around August through November. This has to do with the improper biases that are applied throughout the model's lifespan, particularly the sensitivity of the reference model beginning with bad intitial conditions.
